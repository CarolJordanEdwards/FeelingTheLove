Feeling The Love

=============================

Feeling The Love browser extension

This is an extension for Google's Chrome web browser which injects @rfreebern's Falling-in-Love script into any web page.

Falling-in-Love does all the heavy lifting. You can find it at http://blog.rnf.me/Falling-in-Love/

An options page allows you to set certain parameters for the script, including when it will run (set the month and day to 0 to run anytime).

Too much love can slow down your browser or spin up your fans!

The extension is written by John Romkey of Blue Forest Research, LLC.
